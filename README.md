### Eat The Burger

Eat The Burger is a full-stack app using Javascript and Handlebars templating on the front end and Node / Express js with MySQL / Sequelize for the back end.  The app allows you to create burgers that are saved in the database and that can either be left for other people to "purchase" and "eat" (Select and delete) or eaten by your self!  It was a fun experimentation with SQL and Sequelize in a full-stack application!
